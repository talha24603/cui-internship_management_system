# CUI Internship Management System
## Project Overview

The **CUI Internship Management System** is designed to digitize and streamline the internship process defined by the **Internship Handbook**. It provides a web-based platform for students, supervisors, and the Internship Office to manage internships, reports, evaluations, and results efficiently.

This system ensures alignment with university academic policies, supports freelancing-based internships (Fiverr/Upwork), and automates reporting, approval, and grading.
